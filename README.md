This is a Landing Page project

The focus is to train html and CSS coding in order to create:

A homepage with 6 news of my choice about the Covid-19;

A page about myself;

A page of subscription;

A page with the news origins and fonts.

It is a bit crude, but it is a step towards perfection (Or I Hope so...)

"It ain't much, but it's honest work..."
